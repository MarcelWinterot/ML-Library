# ML Library
### Repository that simulates the keras api release by Google.
### Currently written in python as it's a project to learn how keras works on lower level, but I will rewrite it to Rust after releasing v. 1.0

## Documentation
### Will write it in the future, when I release the first version. I'm planning to release it at the start of November
