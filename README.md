# ML Library

### Repository that imiates the keras api released by Google.

### Currently written in python as it's a project to learn how popular ML Libraries work on lower level, but I will rewrite it to Rust/C++/mojo/go after releasing v. 1.0.

## Documentation

### Will write it in the future, when I release the first version. I'm planning to release it on the 5th of November.
