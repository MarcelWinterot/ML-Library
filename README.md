# ML Library
### Repository that simulates the keras api release by Google.
### Currently written in python as it's a project to learn how keras works on lower level, but I might change it to mojo or c++ later.

## Documentation
### Will write it in the future, when I release the first version. I'm planning to release it at the start of November
